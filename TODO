* Validity check of dependencies noted in a metaparam.json against an
  environments Puppetfile
  metaparam.json should be a required parameter with no default

  Also possible would be to find all metaparam.json's below the dirname
  of the given Puppetfile, matching against those

  On the other hand many keep their local clones of modules beside the
  environment, which'd favor matching against found metaparams below the
  current path

* Mock api calls in aruba tests
  Not as easy as with rspec, see https://github.com/cucumber/aruba/issues/169
  However using arubas in-process execution it is possible to use webmock to mock these calls.

  It is quite ugly though: https://github.com/erikhuda/thor/wiki/Integrating-with-Aruba-In-Process-Runs
